          <p>According to the World Health Organization, unsafe injection practices are responsible for transmitting an estimated 20 million cases of hepatitis B (HBV),two million cases of hepatitis C (HCV) and approximately 260 000 cases of HIV each year. In developing and transitional nations, unsafe injections account for 32% of new HBV infections. That translates into a total of 21 million people infected needlessly through a combination of carelessness, poverty, greed, ignorance or a simple lack of resources for safe injection equipment and education.Unsafe injection practices also
          account for the majority of new HCV infections in developing and transitional countries â€“ adding up to a total of 40% of new cases each year. Although HIV is less readily transmissible than HBV and HCV, fully 5% of new HIV infections worldwide can be attributed to unsafe injections.3 In the Middle East and South Asia, where unsafe practices verge on the epidemic, those figures are likely to be far higher HBV, HCV and HIV are chronic conditions that lead to disease, disability and even death a number of years following initial infection. Many of those infected with HBV in early childhood will go on to develop chronic liver disease by the time they turn 30. Needless to say, this can have a dramatic effect on struggling national economies.</p>
